This folder has implementation of DecisionTree algorithm for car and bank datasets. <br>
**To run the scripts use the below commands:** <br>
python3 DecisionTreeCar.py - to run the decision tree learning algorithm on car dataset <br>
python3 DecisionTreeBank.py - to run the decision tree learning algorithm on bank dataset <br>
python3 DecisionTreeBankMissing.py - to run the decision tree learning algorithm on bank dataset where the unknown values are replaced with mode <br>
**To change the depth** <br>
Change the range of the depth in the main function to vary the tree depth. <br>
